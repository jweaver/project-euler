# project-euler

A project for solutions written in Clojure for Project Euler (projecteuler.net).  My hopes and goals with this are to improve the solutions over time, and add new solutions to the (many) problems on Project Euler.  Since this is my first foray into Clojure, I fully expect some solutions to not be as idiomatic as they should be.

## Usage

Clone and run with

    lein test

Tests are written for each Problem set in Euler.  In the future I'll probably figure out a nice and neat way of running these without leiningen repl or test.  A GUI in swing might be fun.  Who knows.
